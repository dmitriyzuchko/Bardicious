About:

Born in Ukraine on the April of 1996, yet moved to Brooklyn after the age of 4, I grew up with an inclination towards the arts. I had sporadic interactions with art education between the ages of 4-18 and applied to the Fashion Institute of Technology in 2014, where I graduated with a BFA in Illustration and a minor in Art History in 2018.  

As a child, my favorite pass time was to roam through children's books and live through the illustrations. Favoring to determine their meaning through high amounts of speculation. When I drew my own artwork, I wanted the same worldly flair, albeit of the fantastical variety. 

My dearest and most focal interests are: ancient and medieval history, fairy tales and their retellings, and European mythology, ie Arthurian and Norse. 

All of which have led me to my current project, a comic called ALBION, written and drawn by myself. An Arthurian retelling that follows the adventures of Merlin in a time before King Arthur. 

When I'm not working on my comic, I will draw book covers, book illustrations and character design. I favor digital painting and create most of my work through Clip Studio Paint.
